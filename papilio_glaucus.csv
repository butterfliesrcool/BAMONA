Asclepias tuberosa is a reliable draw for some species. This raggedy Eastern Tiger Swallowtail couldn't get enough and totally ignored my picture taking.

Wingate Prairie is 39 acres of a very rare gravel hill prairie. The natural area is precious because only 59 acres of gravel hill prairie are known to exist in Illinois. In 1994, the Illinois Nature Preserve Commission designated the prairie as an Illinois Nature Preserve. Only sites with statewide ecological value are considered for this highest level of protection under Illinois law. This unique prairie land, with its rolling terrain, oak savanna and conifer groupings, is home to several rare and endangered plant and animal species including the Prairie Buttercup, Pinweed, Queen of the Prairie, Pale Vetchling, Purple Flowering Raspberry, Silvery Blue Butterfly, and the Franklin Ground Squirrel. During its active months from spring to fall, the prairie is in constant bloom. Nature lovers are welcomed by hiking trails that are moderate to very hilly that meander through the prairie. From hill to hollow, the type of native vegetation waiting to be discovered varies. A flat moraine at the northern end of the site is home to yet another variety of plants not requiring the well-drained soil of the hills or the damp hollow areas.",,WI_Dan (136733),,,08/31/2020 11:17:11

My courtyard has sunflowers, snap dragons, cone flowers, salvia, geraniums and others.","Construction worker walked over and handed me what appeared to be an injured butterfly, perhaps because there are butterflies on my sign? It seemed dazed, possible with an injured leg, Friend and I put it in my flower bed, broke off a cone type flower and drenched it in water then placed it next to the butterfly. We kept a close eye on it. It wasn't moving but after a while started moving it's wings slightly. About an hour later it had moved to feeding off the flower but didn't leave it. It opened and closed its wings.  I kept watching and a couple of hours later it was still there. The next morning it was gone. I looked everywhere. This afternoon a few days later I stopped by my shop. I was in the courtyard and what appeared to be the same or perhaps a similar butterfly swooped by and flew around in front of me and disappeared around the corner. I had not seen this type of butterfly previously. I have always liked butterflies but began seeing them more frequently when I was diagnosed with a brain tumor. I don't know why probably I started paying more attention to them. When I went on my first survivor walk (which I really didn't want to be at) a monarch flew into my group and began circling around next to me. I have a newfound appreciation for life and butterflies. I was very, very lucky to have a non-cancerous tumor and really no effects after 7 1/2 hours of brain surgery. I quit my corporate job, opened an art gallery and my logo has a butterfly as part of it. The courtyard of that gallery is where my friend (who designed my logo) and I were when presented with the injured, or maybe just dazed butterfly.",Creative Soul (137846),,,08/10/2020 10:59:54
