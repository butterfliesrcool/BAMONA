Near Picnic area in large park, lots of people around.  The butterfly soared in over our picnic table and landed about 20 meters from the picnic area.  The site is in a low growth area (mostly weeds) between a paved walkway and a stand of deciduous trees.  Apparently, the butterfly was feeding on small flowers in the weeds.

Activity:  Early spring, Lilacs have bloomed and the butterfly was seen earlier in the morning and then later in the day, when shots were taken.  According to my book (Kaufman: Field Guide to Butterflies of North America), this one is a male.  He worked the lilac blossoms fluttering from one to another.  Unusual in my experience is that he never stopped fluttering his wings, the butterflies that I have seen usually rest their wings while feeding.  Even when on a blossom he fluttered them.

I was rearing the spicebush caterpillar with no difficulty until the 5th instar. When its food source (cuttings of spicebush placed in water) began to wilt and dry up, it escaped the tank and was found several hours later. Soon after, it vomited brown foul smelling liquid. Because I did not have access to fresh foliage for 2-3 days, the caterpillar began to starve and would occasionally nibble on dried spicebush leaves. At this point, it began to shrink, its skin started to bunch up with the pattern distorted, and it displayed poor righting and grasping reflexes with no use of the osmeterium. Even after restocking the tank with fresh sassafras and spicebush leaves, it only nibbled on sassafras for a little while. It is not eating anywhere near its expected rate.

Beautiful yellow creature crawling on a walking trail we frequent. We broke a small branch off a nearby sassafras tree, took the caterpillar home, and put it in our butterfly cage; we were hoping to make it a learning experience for the grandkids. We kept that caterpillar for the next 259 days, eventually giving up any hope that a butterfly would emerge, but this morning when I stepped outside and looked, out of habit, there was a butterfly!!! We unzipped the butterfly cage, carefully removed the little branch holding the remains of the chrysalis and the newly emerged butterfly, tucked the branch into a sheltered spot in some honeysuckle and watched it quietly resting and drying its wings, and then it was time to leave for church. When we got home later this afternoon, the butterfly was gone, as we expected. We can’t help but wonder if 259 days is normal at all!!",treys grammy (7574),,,06/14/2021 19:04:40
