The weather was very hot (up to 90s F) and dry and it was in early evening as I was watering after being away for a few days- The caterpillars were very visible, and not moving or moving very slowly. I plucked one caterpillar off and placed it in small screened bug house i had bought at the ""dollar"" store. I put new Rue leaves in right away, with a few drops of water- and sat the little house on an outside table in a shady spot outside.  I put new Rue leaves (dunked in water) into the bug house for the next 2 or 3 days -at I which point we saw that it had stopped eating and had already attached itself to a corner spot in prep for making it's cocoon/chrysalis- We keep checking it 2 to 4 times a day - is there anything else we should do?

On  6/28/15 it formed a chrysalis (see picture), which it stayed in until 7/8/15 (about 10 days), when it turned dark, and emerged as a butterfly (see picture.)  The colors were black and light yellow, and it had small tails at the bottom of each wing, one of which got damaged and fell off.  Within 24 hours it was flying in the butterfly pop-up house we had, and it was clear it needed more room.  I would estimate the wingspan of the butterfly was between 4-5"".

I also noticed that the birds were having a real feast and after 2 days, only 4 of the original 10 caterpillars were left. So the kids and I decided to house these caterpillars in a little pavilion, with their favorite food. We attached a few sticks to the pavilion walls and less than a week later, the caterpillars had turned into pupae that attached themselves onto the sticks. The pavilion spent the winter under our deck and once spring arrived, we checked daily if something was happening. Today was a big day as two of the butterflies emerged from their pupae and flew off into the garden.  Hopefully they will stay nearby and we will be seeing more caterpillars ravaging our parsley.
